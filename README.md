# `BG3-Proving-Grounds`

This mod project is a proving-grounds for ideas and experiments that I want to prototype, without turning them into an actual mod yet. This repository is an amalgamation of a variety of mod-ideas, where an idea is tested before it evolves into a separate project of its own.

## Repository Structure

The mod files are symlinked loosely to the Game's data folder instead being `.pak`ed - as the entire point of this project is quick-iteration and prototyping.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### [BG3 Mod Manager][BG3MM]

> LaughingLeader's [BG3 Mod Manager][BG3MM] is the recommended way to install mods for Baldur's Gate 3. You can download the software from [here][BG3MM].

3. Select the package (`.pak` or `.zip`) you just downloaded.
